# Cub3D

The goal of the Cub3D project is to create a 3D maze game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, using the Ray-Casting technique and 42's graphic library.

## Project Description

In this project, you will create a simplified version of a game engine. The main objective is to familiarize yourself with computer graphics, optimization issues, and game dynamics. You will have to create a dynamic view inside a maze from a first-person perspective, using the Ray-Casting technique.

## Game Rules

- The player's objective is to navigate through a maze and reach the exit while avoiding obstacles and enemies.
- The player can move forward, backward, and sideways, as well as rotate the view to look around.
- Walls, doors, and other obstacles must be displayed realistically, with proper textures and shading.

## Compilation Example: Cub3D

To compile the `Cub3D` program, run:

```bash
make
./cub3D maps/correct_map.cub
```
